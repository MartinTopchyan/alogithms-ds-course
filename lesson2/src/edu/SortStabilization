1. Insertion sort
Insertion sort is stable because it doesn't do swap operation
it is expecting that the left side is already sorted,
so if the current value is greater than his previous it will just skip.
[5,2,2,4,6]
[2,5,2,4,6]
[2,2,5,4,6]
[2,2,4,5,6]


2. Selection sort
Selection sort is not stable because when it will find the minimum it will swap the first one and with that the order will be changed.

3. Bubble sort
Bubble sort is stable because it doing swap only with the next element, so in that case the order can't be changed.
